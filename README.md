# Link_Budget_Calculation

This set of codes performs an assessment of the feasibility of Low-Earth Orbit
Constellations to address the last-mile problem in Broadband connectivity in Kenya. 
This code heavily relies on work done by Ed Noughton and Bonface Osoro in their Article:

"A Techno-Economic Framework for Satellite
Networks Applied to Low Earth Orbit
Constellations: Assessing Starlink,
OneWeb and Kuiper"

# Contents
The program entails an Engineering Model for the Operational Mechanics of each of the Constellations
A geo-information model that extracts population data from a global raster dataset and an Intersecting program that
matches keys from both the latter models.
